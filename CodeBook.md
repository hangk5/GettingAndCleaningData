#Data analysis of Human Activities Recognition Using Smartphones

The data generated by the script (run_analysis.R) is based on the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy smartphone.
##Data transformation
###Tidying data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
	* filter only interested features by filtering feature table using feature names containing mean() and std() 
	* from tables in x_train.txt and x_test.txt select only columns corresponding to interested features (using first column of filtered feature table
	* merge columns from tables from y_train.txt, subject _train.txt and subsetted x_train table
	* merge columns from tables from y_test.txt, subject _test.txt and subsetted x_test table
	* merge rows from train table and test table generated from above steps
	* change column names using descriptive text	* 
###Create a new tidy data set based on the above tidy data set
	* this data set contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
	* using reshape2 package, reshape data to long format (melt)
	* reshape data to wide format, average each variable using "activity" and "subject"
	* write data to file "human_activities.txt"
##Data description for human_activities.txt
The data has 68 columns, the header row containing the names for each column and 180 data rows.
Here are the columns:
	activity: activity type ("LAYING", "SITTING", "STANDING", "WALKING", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS")
	subject: person identifier for the activity (1-30)
	the next 66 columns are for average of mean and standard deviation of each feature for each activity and subject.
